Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 

What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The code I was given was the code that created the game and allowed the game to be played using the algorithms provided for playing the game and also to use
the QValue to create the reinforcement learning. I created the code that used the QValue algorithm to train the agent to win the game and learn from the games that 
lost or had less percentage of winning.


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, analyze, and optimize algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently, 
create software systems, and develop technologies that drive innovation across industries. Their work is essential in advancing technology, improving efficiency, and finding solutions to real-world problems, from healthcare to finance.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I first clearly understand the problem and break it down into smaller components.
Then I identify existing solutions, tools, or methods that may be useful.
Next I sketch a solution or design a quick prototype to test ideas.
Then I refine the solution through cycles of testing, feedback, and optimization.
Finally I assess if the solution meets all requirements, both functional and ethical.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ensuring usability, privacy, and security in software design to protect and respect the user's rights. Maintaining code quality, data integrity, and transparent documentation, supporting organizational goals without compromising ethical standards.
